We've prepared a Jupyter notebook that will guide you through the process of building and training a Traffic Sign Classification network with Keras.


## Instructions

1. Set up your development environment with the [CarND Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md)
2. Launch the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook traffic-sign-classification-with-keras.ipynb`
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook


Since this is a self-assessed lab, you can view the solution by running the `traffic-sign-classification-with-keras-solution.ipynb` notebook. Make sure you're only running one notebook at a time.

## Help
Remember that you can get assistance from mentors and fellow students in Student Hub or in Knowledge. You can also review the concepts from the previous lessons, or consult external documentation.
